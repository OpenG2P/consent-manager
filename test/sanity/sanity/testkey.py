"""A fixed TEST-ONLY Ed25519 private key for the sanity e2e.

This key exists SOLELY so the sanity suite can seed a persistent test partner in
Partner Management and then sign a consent object that verifies against it. It is
NOT secret and MUST NEVER be used by a real partner — the sanity partner is bound
to a dedicated test controller/audience and is inert for real data sharing.

Only the private key is stored: the public half (which is what PM stores) is
derived from it at seed time, so there is a single source of truth for the pair.

Override with SANITY_PM_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM (+ a matching PM-seeded key) in
environments where you'd rather manage your own test key.
